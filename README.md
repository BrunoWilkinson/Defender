# Defender

Space invader like game! With a small twist you have no cover but have an actionable shield to survive the horde of monsters.

How long can you survive ?! 
If you have any suggestions add them in the comment section below, I'm open to feedback!

Controls:

- AD or Arrows key to move Left or Right

- Left mouse click to shoot
- Right mouse click to block with shield
Thank you for playing!
